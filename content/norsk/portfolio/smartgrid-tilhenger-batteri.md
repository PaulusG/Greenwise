Enabling large-scale charging
SmartGrid’s energy storage systems are designed to support ultra-fast charging for trucks and delivery vehicles, providing constant output independent of grid connections. Our modular systems can easily be scaled, connected and extended to support vehicle fleets of any size and future growth. Simply connect fast chargers to the built-in DC or AC connections, or contact us for a custom storage solution with integrated CCS2 fast chargers.

​

To power the extra mile whenever you need it, SmartGrid’s battery systems support deep discharging without any long-term implications on battery cell health or capacity.

Powering vehicle charging for transport and logistics
Tomorrow’s zero-emissions zones for trucks and delivery vehicles are creating new charging and network challenges for electric vehicle fleets. At SmartGrid, we are the partner for charging-ready battery systems to power your EV logistics and transport.
