The GIRAFFE is a state-of-the art hybrid solution that catches the eyes of everyone and provides higher energy density thanany other product on the market.

The curved wooden frame of the GIRAFFE is made out of
glue-laminated larch wood and incorporates intelligent angling of the solar panels which enables 40 m2 of solar panels on a 25 m2 footprint and micro-inverters which offers an additional four hours of energy production.

This award-winning hybrid solution is highly suitable as a charging station for eMobility vehicles or as an eye-catching power station for businesses, small/
medium houses, community projects, and other public spaces.
