The GIRAFFE

is a state-of-theart
hybrid solution that catches
the eyes of everyone and provides
higher energy density than
any other product on the market.
The curved wooden frame
of the GIRAFFE is made out of
glue-laminated larch wood and
incorporates intelligent angling
of the solar panels which enables
40 m2 of solar panels on a
25 m2 footprint and micro-inverters
which offers an additional
four hours of energy production.
This award-winning hybrid solution
is highly suitable as a charging
station for eMobility vehicles
or as an eye-catching power
station for businesses, small/
medium houses, community projects,
and other public spaces
