The DALI is based on the 12-meter-high tower has a unique and
patent-protected design that enables tower installation and maintenance without use of a cranes.

The Dali tower offers a wide range of systems, from pure wind to hybrid solutions, that covers many different needs.

As with all of the INNOVENTUM products, the tower is made out of wood and utilizes recycled metal screws as foundation.
All of the products in the DALI range are also suitable for an on grid or mini-grid configuration.

The Dali is also avaible for a direct battery-charging configuration (off-grid) as the Dali 4.5.

The DALI is a pure small wind solution that offers locally produced energy that is suitable for small businesses and homes.

The DALI POWERTOWER is a hybrid system that is based on the DALI and maximizes energy production.

It provides sustainable and locally produced energy by a combination of both a wind turbine and solar panels (PV) to small houses and businesses.

The standard configuration is with 8 panels but it is possible to add up to 20 panels.

Robusta trätorn.
Våra torn är designade för att klara vindar upp till 60 m/s och deras livslängd beräknas till långt över 25 år.
